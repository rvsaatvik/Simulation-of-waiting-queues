-NJIT COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
Intensive study of the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. Presents the definitions, representations, processing algorithms for data structures, general design and analysis techniques for algorithms. Covers a broad variety of data structures, algorithms and their applications including linked lists, various tree organizations, hash tables, strings, storage allocation, algorithms for searching and sorting, and a selected collection of other algorithms. Programs are assigned to give students experience in algorithms, data structure design and implementation.

This is a simulation of waiting queues at an airline check-in counter, organized as follows, 
-There are two types of passengers: first clas, and coach.  
-There are two service stations for first class, and three for coach.  
-There is a single queue for each type of passenger (first class, coach).  
-Passenger arrival times are random and are generatored by a random number generator.  
-Average arrival rates for passengers are R1 for first class and R2 for coach.  
These are decided at run-time by prompting the user.  
-Service time is random and varies uniformly between 1 and S1 for first class, 
and between 1 and S2 for coach.  
Parameters S1 and S2 are also determined at run-time, by prompting the user.  
-Whenever a service station is available and the corresponding queue is not empty, 
we pick the passenger at the front of the queue and place her/him on the service station.  
-Whenever a first class service station is available and the first class queue is empty, 
the service station may service a passenger from coach.  
-The duration of the expeeriment, in minutes, is decided by the user at run time.  
-Statistics generated by the simulation include: average service time, maximum service time, 
number served in each class, maximum queue length for each type of passenger.
